# README louiseclarka11y.com

Hi! I'm Louise Clark, an accessibility consultant and service designer. This is the repository for my portfolio site where I share my work in making digital services more inclusive.

I'm building this site with a few goals in mind:
- Showcase my accessibility, product, and service design work
- Practice what I preach with WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- Document my return to regular development
- Be transparent about using AI as a learning tool

The site is built with Eleventy Excellent starter and will eventually feature case studies, thoughts on inclusive design, and resources for building more accessible web experiences.


## Building in Public ðŸš§

I'm developing this portfolio openly because I believe in learning in public. You can see my actual commits, my decision-making process, and yes, even my mistakes and iterations.

This is my personal site, but I'm treating it like a professional project because practice makes perfect. I'm focusing on making it accessible by default (WCAG 2.2 AA), sustainable following W3C guidelines, and I'm being transparent about when AI tools help me out.

### How I Work

Even though I'm flying solo on this project, I follow the same practices I'd use on a team. I've documented my workflow [over here](./docs/my-workflow.md) if you're curious about things like why I create PRs for myself or how I organize my branches.

If you notice any accessibility issues while browsing, I'd genuinely appreciate a heads up through an issue. I'm always learning and accessibility feedback is gold.

### Following Along

Feel free to watch how this site evolves. Everything from my [AI collaboration logs](./ai-collaboration/) to my [architecture decisions](./docs/adrs/) is here in the open. It's all part of the learning journey.

# AI Usage Policy for louiseclarka11y.com

## Why This Policy Exists

I'm building my portfolio site in public with AI assistance, and I want to be completely transparent about how I use these tools. This policy explains my approach to working with AI while maintaining my own decision-making authority.

## Core Principles

**Human agency matters most.** I've specifically instructed AI tools to present options and ask what I want rather than making assumptions. Every decision in this project is mine. AI just helps me explore possibilities.

**Transparency builds trust.** All AI assistance is documented publicly in this repository. You can see exactly when and how AI supported the development process.

**Learning, not replacing.** AI helps me understand best practices and synthesize information from experts I trust, but it doesn't replace my need to understand the code I write. In fact, it's helping me remember my frontend coding skills (Git, Github, working with terminal...) that I haven't used in awhile and need a refresher.

## How I Work With AI

I use AI as a research assistant and documentation helper. When I'm exploring accessibility patterns, AI helps me pull together practices from experts like Marcy Sutton, Rachele DiTullio, and Eric Bailey. It's particularly helpful for formatting templates and explaining technical concepts in plain language.

What AI doesn't do is make choices for me. I don't use AI for design decisions, architectural choices, or creating original content. The code logic, user experience decisions, and overall direction of the project are entirely human-driven.

## Documentation Approach

Every significant AI interaction gets logged in `/ai-collaboration/assistance-log.md`. When AI substantially helps with a commit, I prefix it with [AI] so it's clear in the git history. Each pull request notes whether AI assistance was used, and my architectural decision records include a section on AI collaboration when relevant.

## Current Tools

Right now I'm using Claude (Anthropic) for development support. I've decided to defer GitHub Copilot until I've rebuilt my coding skills. You can read about that decision in ADR-002.

## My Commitment

All AI suggestions are tested and understood before implementation. I verify accessibility and sustainability impacts. Expert sources are properly credited. And since AI can't access my repository directly, every line of code is manually reviewed and consciously added.
